Chapter 3 - Reinforcement Exercise 3-3 (Pg 187)

Create a program that calculates an employeeâ€™s weekly gross salary, based on the number of hours worked and an hourly wage that you choose. You will create an HTML document containing a form with two text boxes:

    1. The number of hours worked
    2. The hourly wage. 

Submit the form to the Default.aspx file. Calculate the pay in a function that returns a string containing the amount to the calling statement, which prints the string. Compute any hours over 40 as time and a half. Use the appropriate decision structure to create the program. Name the project as Paycheck.
